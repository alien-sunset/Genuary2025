## day 1

started on a base of @tenprint 's Tracery.
I was actually aiming for a maze pattern, but hit on something that reminded me more of weaving, and then wandered my way to this.
kinda want to steal an idea from @HitomezashiBot and see if i can do some remembering and mirroring of elements to get something that looks like actual twill weaving patterns, but it's late and that will have to wait for another day.
