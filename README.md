# Genuary2025

genuary 2025 stuff

some of these will liekly become new bots in the future.



### day 1

Vertical or horizontal lines only.

![a collage of four multi colored images of random weave patterns generated using only horizontal and vertical lines](day1.jpg)

started on a base of [@tenprint](https://github.com/alien-sunset/tracery-bots/tree/main/TenPrint) 's Tracery.

I was actually aiming for a maze pattern, but hit on something that reminded me more of weaving, and then wandered my way to this.

kinda want to steal an idea from [@HitomezashiBot](https://github.com/alien-sunset/tracery-bots/tree/main/hitomezashi) and see if i can do some remembering and mirroring of elements to get something that looks like actual twill weaving patterns, but it's late and that will have to wait for another day.



### day 2 ( & 3 )

Layers upon layers upon layers.

![a collage of four images with alt text, each is a pastel square segmented into 4 smaller pastel squares with three multi off kilter semi opaque squares of various colors layered on top of it with 6 progressively smaller multi colored off kilter squares outlines layered on top of them.](day2.jpg)

inspired by some of the works of [Vera Molnár](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r), this idea had actually been percolating in the back of my mind for a while, but i just kept getting distracted.

also sorta counts as day 3, as the Tracery (with spaces) is exactly 42 lines. which is nice as I have an appointment tomorrow and won't be able to do much else.


### day 4

Black on black.

![a collage of four images with alt text, each is a black square with very dark, almost black multicolored, circles of various sizes scattered about with similarly dark multicolored lines crisscrossing it over everything.](day4.jpg)

I dunno, it kiiiinda fits, these are all "hues" of black, yeeeah. i was going fo a kinda "dark laser show" kinda look, and I think i get that pretty well.
Either way it looks kinda cool, and I’m pretty happy with the outcome, even if it can be extra hard to tell whats going on on especially dark/high contrast screens.


### day 5 & 6

Isometric Art & Make a landscape using only primitive shapes

![a collage of four images, each is a square with a blue gradient going from top to bottom, superimposed on top of this is a flat isometric plane made of cubes of various shades of greens -"grass", sometimes this plane has a small patch of squares made of various shades of blue, with pale beige squares bordering the green on the righthand front edge - "water and sand", or a hill will various shades of brown on its sides in the back corner, or a small tree on it's lefthand corner, or two, all three, each built out of small cubes.](day5-6.jpg)

ok, I admit it, I like playing Minecraft. I wasn't sure what I was going to do for day five OR six, and certainly wasn't planning on combining them in the beginning, but then the idea just struck me one evening while my family was playing together.

was pretty fun overall, and I got to really work my spacial thinking muscles to make the cubes and put everything together properly.

### day 7

Use software that is not intended to create art or images.

![a collage of several screenshots from the game Minecraft, the player is looking at several famous pieces of art that have been rendered into pixel art via MapArt using Minecraft's in world mapping feature.](day7.png)

I originally wasn't going to submit anything for this day as i had a self imposed challenge of doing everything via tracery and/or svg. but i was reminded of all the map art i had made in my family's season 4 Minecraft server. when Minecraft is ostensibly a survival/building/farming sim/sandbox game and not really made for generating visual art.


### day 8

Draw one million of something.

![a collage of several images: starting with one with a grouping of multicolored stars, then a smattering of several groupings, then a larger covering of multiple groupings then finally six images of groupings upon groupings - approximately ten thousand stars per image](day8.jpg)

![a short double speed screenshot video a mouse clicks teh reload button on a web browser displaying a black square covered in a million multi colored stars. the square clears and the program begins drawing more stars, the center quickly fills up and then batches slowly continue appearing, layering on top until finished.](day8.mp4)

this one kinda killed my poor computer... a million is A LOT! this is all tracery/JavaScript rendering into SVG it took several seconds to finish processing the tracery and then over two minutes to finish drawing all the stars. I’m sure i could have chosen something smaller/simpler to draw for this one, but what would the fun have been in that?
