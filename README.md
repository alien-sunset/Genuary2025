## day 1

![a collage of four multi colored images of random weave patterns generated using only horizontal and vertical lines](day1.json)

started on a base of [@tenprint](https://github.com/alien-sunset/tracery-bots/tree/main/TenPrint) 's Tracery.

I was actually aiming for a maze pattern, but hit on something that reminded me more of weaving, and then wandered my way to this.

kinda want to steal an idea from [@HitomezashiBot](https://github.com/alien-sunset/tracery-bots/tree/main/hitomezashi) and see if i can do some remembering and mirroring of elements to get something that looks like actual twill weaving patterns, but it's late and that will have to wait for another day.
