genuary 2025 stuff

some of these will liekly become new bots in the future.



### day 1

Vertical or horizontal lines only.

![a collage of four multi colored images of random weave patterns generated using only horizontal and vertical lines](day1.jpg)

started on a base of [@tenprint](https://github.com/alien-sunset/tracery-bots/tree/main/TenPrint) 's Tracery.

I was actually aiming for a maze pattern, but hit on something that reminded me more of weaving, and then wandered my way to this.

kinda want to steal an idea from [@HitomezashiBot](https://github.com/alien-sunset/tracery-bots/tree/main/hitomezashi) and see if i can do some remembering and mirroring of elements to get something that looks like actual twill weaving patterns, but it's late and that will have to wait for another day.



### day 2 ( & 3 )

Layers upon layers upon layers.

![a collage of four images with alt text, each is a pastel square segmented into 4 smaller pastel squares with three multi off kilter semi opaque squares of various colors layered on top of it with 6 progressively smaller multi colored off kilter squares outlines layered on top of them.](day2.jpg)

inspired by some of the works of [Vera Moln√°r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r), this idea had actually been percolating in the back of my mind for a while, but i just kept getting distracted.

also sorta counts as day 3, as the Tracery (with spaces) is exactly 42 lines. which is nice as I have an appointment tomorrow and won't be able to do much else.
